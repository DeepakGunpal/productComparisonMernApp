# productComparisonMernApp

Test

Imagine, a MERN-based comparison page that lets you compare 2 products. 
The page URL may look something like this:
â€ƒhttps://.../compare?productIds[]=p1001&productIds[]=p22

This comparison page needs to show name, price, and ratings in a table for the 2 productIds in the URL. Mongo products table has fields {_id, name, price, ratings}.

Kindly fill in the blanks to complete the outline of a comparison page code. Feel free to rewrite sentences to discuss your approach if you are uncomfortable with Redux.

a) You will use ____useState________ hook that returns the current state, say products, and the function ___setState_________ that updates the state.

b) You will use ___useEffect________ hook to make an API call and post the following payload: ____productName______ .

c) API will use the above payload and get data in **one** query: ___findOne________. (Note: Provide the actual Mongo/Mongoose query you'd use.)

d) API will return the following JSON data: ___product name price and ratings________.

e) __useState_______ hook will receive this data from API and will use the function ____setState______ to update state and re-render the component.

f) How well can you speak and understand Hindi? _native speaker___________
